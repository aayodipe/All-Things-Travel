# All Things Travel
This  is a travelling application which allow user to search for cheap flight, hotel and resturant. This application was created by a team of 4 members. This application was created as a solution to a team project.

The project requirement is, working in a team of four, create something amazing.  The application must utilize at least two APIs using AJAX and have a professional look and it must have something repeating such as a table or columns.

The Solution:  We decided on a travel website utilizing the Kayak, Zomato, and Weatherbit APIs.  Our design was a very clean look with a carousel of images to iconic locations with inputs for the users departure city, destination, when they are leaving and returning, how many travels, and number of bags.  This information was passed through all of the APIs and populated on the page in one view with links to the Kayak website for more flight information or the website/menu of popular restuarants in the destination city.

The experience:  This project was our first group project and challenged us to work as a team to divide and conquer.  The local weather was also a challenging factor and several class periods devoted to group work were done remotely making group work difficult.  We overcame and delivered a simple working project.  We all have improvement ideas for the site in the future.
